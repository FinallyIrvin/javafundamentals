# Java Programming Terms
## We will be adding java terms to this as we go through the course. This will help you understand common programming terms along with Java specific ones.

#### Basic Syntax and Coding Conventions
**Case sensitivity** - Java is case-sensitive, which means Hello and hello have different meanings. 
**Class Names** - All class names should use Pascal Case (Upper Camel Case). This means the first letter of each word that makes up the class should be capitalized. 
**Method Names** - All methods should be Camel Case (Lower Camel Case). This means the first letter of the first word is lower case and each word after is capitalized.
**Program File Name** - The name of the program should match the class name.
**Main Method** - Java application begin from the main method. This method is executed when you run th application. You can however have more than one main method, but only one of them can be targeted to run at a time.

#### Lesson 3
**class** - A blueprint or object for creating other objects. It describes what the object knows (state) and what it does (behavior). Objects are immutable.
**constructor** - A constructor is a special method used in a class for the instantiation process. A constructor has no return type and is automatically called if it is not defined in a class. 
**method** - A behavior that belongs to a class, that allows a set of statements to be executed together as a block. This behavior is only executed when the method is called.
**comments** - This type of statement is ignored by the compiler when you execute a program. They are used in various ways, such as preventing the execution of code, or providing documentation.
